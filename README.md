# ETL-Project
ETL project
Researched many sites for data. Scraped data from FiveThiryEight. The data used was formatted in CSV and available JSON.
Pandas and Python was then used to transform and read the data set. CSV datasets then were stored into a dataframe via file path
location. Transformations included cleaning data by setting different column names and setting data types to corresponding data
types like int64 to be readable with pandas. The dataframes were successfully loaded into PostgresSQL for further analysis and data
manipulation
